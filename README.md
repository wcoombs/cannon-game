<br>

A cannon-shooting game. You control the cannon on the left and an AI controls the cannon on the right. Aim with the mouse and click to fire (you can only fire if there is no cannonball of yours in the air). Every time you hit the enemy cannon, your score increases and the enemy respawns in a new location. If you are hit, the game is over.

Written in Java, this program can be run with the [Processing](https://processing.org/) application.
